💻 PROJECTS :

👌 PROS : 
May be obsessed with having a clean code, and learning fast.

🥲 CONS : 
I hate letting some bug interfere in my work, so I always try to debog my code by myself as soon as I see one even If I have to spend time on it.

💖 I'd appreciate if you like my work. If you have any productive comment or advice to give me, please do. 

💖 Have a good visit !
