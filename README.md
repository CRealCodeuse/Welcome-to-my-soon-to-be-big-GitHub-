🤩 HEY THERE ! Welcome on my GitHub !



🎓 My name is Elise. 

💻 I'm in a Web Developpement Bachelor and currently looking for an apprenticeship for now.

💼 There you can see projects I coded or working on currently.
🔗 NB : My portfolio doesn't have a web domain bought yet, but I'm working on it.

✅​ Languages I work with : 
- HTML, CSS : Basic but needed so I put it everywhere.
- JavaScript : Portfolio, ToDoList and other projects have it. 
- Python : Really love this one. Learned but not on any project yet.
- SQL : Learned it but not used yet.
- Php : Learned some.
- And others I want to learn soon (TypeScript, Angular, Rust, React, etc).

💻 Projects :
- Portfolio : HTML, CSS.
- To Do List : HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Others on the way !

👌 Pros: May be obsessed with having a clean code, and learning fast.

🥲 Cons: I hate letting some bug interfere in my work, so I always try to debog my code by myself as soon as I see one even If I have to spend time on it.

💖 I'd appreciate if you like my work. If you have any productive comment or advice to give me, please do. 

💖 Have a good visit !
