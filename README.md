🤩 HEY THERE ! Welcome on my GitHub !



🎓 My name is Elise. 
💻 I'm in a Web Developpement Bachelor and currently looking for an apprenticeship for now.

💼 There you can see projects I coded, as my portfolio.
🔗My portfolio doesn't have a web domain bought yet, but I'm working on it.

✅​ Languages I work with: 
- HTML, 
- CSS, 
- JavaScript, 
- Python, 
- SQL, 
- Php,
- And others I want to learn soon.

👌 Pros: May be obsessed with having a clean code, and learning fast.
🥲 Cons: I hate letting some bug interfere in my work, so I always try to debog my code by myself as soon as I see one even If I have to spend time on it.

💖 I'd appreciate if you like my work. If you have any productive comment or advice to give me, please do. 

💖 Have a good visit !
